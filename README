# Portfolio Website

## Overview
This is a personal portfolio website built to showcase my projects and web development progress. The site includes About, Projects, and Contact sections, plus a Dark Mode toggle and dynamic project rendering.

## Languages / Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Web Storage API (sessionStorage + localStorage)

## Key Features
- Projects are stored as JavaScript objects in an array.
- The project array is saved to `sessionStorage` using `JSON.stringify()`.
- On page load, the site checks for saved project data in `sessionStorage`.
  - If not found, it stores the default project array.
  - If found, it retrieves and parses the data using `JSON.parse()`.
- Projects are rendered dynamically in the Projects section using DOM methods.
